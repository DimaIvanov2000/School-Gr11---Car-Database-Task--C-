# School Gr11 - Car Database Task (C)

A database-like program for cars which was completed in a limited amount of time as a school assignment.

## How to Run

Download the file and / or run the code on your IDE of choice (Codeblocks or DevC++ should both work). The program has some obvious bugs inlcuding the fact that it confirms the deletion of a car before the title screen.

## How to Use

The complete functions of the program include:
    * Store information about cars  
    * load information about cars  
    * sort information about cars  
    * display information about cars  
    * add information about cars  
    * remove information about cars  
    * edit information about cars  
    
### NOTE

This program has many bugs and is missing some crucial functions such as the creation of cars. This is partially becuase is was made within a limited time window and partially because a more refined version may have been lost. Otherwise, the program contains extensive documentation in its code and has a moderately intuitive user interface.
